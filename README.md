# Ultrasound-Generation-via-Android-device
This is the sample for data transfer between the two android devices using the ultrasound.

1. What this code do ? 

This solution requires the most basic hardware in a device (only a speaker and microphone) and is feasible in situations where there is no internet connection. A best use case is making payments between a retailer and customer offline and doing communication during a natural disaster when there is no network.

Sharing data is made possible by using Audio waves, specifically - Ultrasonic waves, which can carry data efficiently and are inaudible to human ears, the best use case is offline payments. These audio waves are processed and made suitable for transmission using Fourier transform algorithm in Java. Our payment solution works even when both the mobile devices are in Airplane Mode.

Here we used the Fourier transforms in processing the Audio signals along with the use CRC algorithms which maintain the integrity of data being transmitted.
